# About

This blog was born out of a necessity. To share my carving for knwledge about the concept of Financial Independence. It's been more than two years now, that I'm fascinated by this concept. 

## A brief history of who I am
Hello, I'm Manfredi, avid learner and curious I started out in Academia to turn into the Tech world. I was born in the city of Palermo, in Sicily, Italy. Palermo, is a beautiful city but generally is considered not a wealthy place. Don't get me wrong, I believe Sicilians are extremely wealthy, they are surrounded by beautiful history, monuments, arts, incredible food, unbelievable sea shores and Islands, wine.... Well for someone coming from there, no place is better in the world. 

But, we are not wealthy San Francisco startup style. People from Sicily tend to have very normal aspirations, like getting a degree, getting a job, buy a house and create a family. There is nothing wrong with that, but it kind of limits your perspective about what life can offer you. 

I was lucky enough to travel a lot in my young age and I discovered many places far from home, and I got to know different perspectives on how you can "own" your life. 

## Why this blog
During my travels and my work/life experiences, I started to get interested in the concept of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). Initially, it was the Vanilla FIRE, with the concept of working hard enough and saving hard enough, so that you can Retire at a very young age without the need of working anymore. Later on, I abandoned this strict concept for a more flexible aspiration to be Financially free and independent. 

I hope that, with this blog, I will be able to share my thoughts and what I've learned with as many people as possible. Not to convince them, but to give them a different perspective on how they can start owning more their life. 

I'm sure I will diverge from the pure Financial Independence topic, but hopefully all the topics I will write about, are at least to me, closely related to the concept of Financial Independence and having a better quality of life.
